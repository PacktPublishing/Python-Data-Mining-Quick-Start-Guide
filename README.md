**A beginner's guide to extracting valuable insights from your data**

## What is this book about?
Data mining is a necessary and predictable response to the dawn of the information age. It is typically defined as the pattern and/or trend discovery phase in the pipeline and Python is a popular tool to perform these tasks as it offers a wide variety of tools for data mining.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Grasp the basics of data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization
* Use the popular Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn for data mining
* Your one-stop guide to build efficient data mining pipelines without going into too much theory
